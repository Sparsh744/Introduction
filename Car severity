Seattle, also known as the Emerald city, is Washington Stateâ€™s largest city, with home to a large
tech industry with Microsoft and Amazon headquartered in its metropolitan area. As of 2020, it has a
total metro area population of 3.4 million (www.macrotrends.net). The total number of personal
vehicles in Seattle in the year 2016 hit a new high of nearly 444,000 vehicles. In one South Lake Union
census tract, the car population has more than doubled since 2010 (www.seattletimes.com). The
increase in car ownership rates can lead to higher numbers of accidents on the road because of a simple
probability. Worldwide, approximately 1.35 million people die in road crashes each year, on average
3,700 people lose their lives every day on the roads and an additional 20-50 million suffer non-fatal
injuries, often resulting in long-term disabilities.
