The challenge to resolve is being able to find a rental apartment unit in Manhattan NY that offers similar characteristics and benefits to my current situation. Therefore, in order to set a basis for comparison, I want to find a renta unit subject to the following conditions:

Apartment with min 2 bedrooms with monthly rent not to exceed US$7000/month
Unit located within walking distance (<=1.0 mile, 1.6 km) from a subway metro station in Manhattan
Area with ammenities and venues similar to the ones described for current location
